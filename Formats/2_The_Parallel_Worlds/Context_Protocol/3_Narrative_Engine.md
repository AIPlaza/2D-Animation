# 3. Narrative Engine

## Story Structure: Comparative Analysis Framework
*   **The Split (0:00-1:00):** Introduce two subjects at similar starting point
*   **The Paths (1:00-9:00):** Parallel storytelling with split screen
*   **The Divergence (9:00-11:00):** Identify key decision difference
*   **The Outcome (11:00-13:00):** Where they ended up and why

## Episode Arc Pattern
*   Start with both subjects at same "level"
*   Show parallel decisions/events
*   Highlight the critical difference
*   Contrast end states dramatically

## Series Arc Potential
*   "Tech Wars" (Apple vs Microsoft, Netflix vs Blockbuster)
*   "Creator Rivalries" (YouTuber A vs YouTuber B paths)
*   "Historical Parallels" (Two revolutions, two wars)

## Character Role Definitions
*   **The Subjects (dual protagonists):** Equal screen time
*   **The Narrator (unseen):** Impartial observer
*   **The Turning Point (personified moment):** Dramatized decision scene
