# 4. Visual Identity

## Animation Style
*   Split-screen minimalism
*   Clean vector art
*   Mirror compositions
*   Color-coded sides (Subject A = Blue, Subject B = Red)
*   Convergence/divergence animations

## Signature Visual Elements
*   Persistent split screen (can merge or separate)
*   Shared timeline at bottom
*   Decision trees that fork
*   Outcome comparison cards

## Color Strategy
*   **Subject A side:** Cool blues/greens (calm, methodical)
*   **Subject B side:** Warm reds/oranges (passionate, risky)
*   **Overlap:** Purple/yellow (shared history)
*   **Divergence points:** Lightning yellow

## Motion Design Principles
*   Synchronized movements on both sides
*   Dramatic desync at decision points
*   Screen "crack" effect when paths split
*   Reunification transitions for comparisons
