# 3. Narrative Engine

## Story Structure: Hypothesis Testing
*   **The Question (0:00-1:00):** Present the "what if"
*   **The Setup (1:00-2:30):** Establish baseline
*   **The Simulation (2:30-10:00):** Run the scenario
*   **The Cascading Effects (10:00-12:00):** Unexpected consequences
*   **The Answer (12:00-14:00):** Final outcome

## Episode Arc Pattern
*   Start with intriguing question
*   Show initial change
*   Domino effects unfold
*   Surprising conclusion

## Series Arc Potential
*   "What If: History" (historical changes)
*   "What If: Science" (physics scenarios)
*   "What If: Society" (social experiments)

## Character Role Definitions
*   **The Experimenter (narrator):** Guides simulation
*   **The Variables (animated elements):** Responsive to changes
*   **The System (world itself):** Reacts to modifications
