# 4. Visual Identity

## Animation Style

*   **Aesthetic:** Paint Explainer + crime board elements
*   Hand-drawn character sketches
*   Evidence board-style connections (red string)
*   Animated graphs showing decline
*   Mugshot-style intro cards

## Signature Visual Elements

*   "Evidence tag" labels on key facts
*   Timeline scrubber at the bottom of the screen
*   "Contributing factors" checklist that fills in
*   Autopsy table metaphor (body = company/career)

## Color Strategy

*   **Primary:** Morgue blues / sterile whites
*   **Accent:** Blood red for key failures
*   **Highlight:** Neon yellow for "smoking gun" moments

## Motion Design Principles

*   Smooth camera pans across evidence
*   Time-lapse effect for showing growth/decline
*   Freeze-frame on critical moments
*   Slow-motion on "the moment it broke"
