## Story Structure: Chronological Compression
*   **The Setup (0:00-1:00):** Establish what made this timeframe significant
*   **Hour by Hour / Day by Day (1:00-10:00):** Rapid sequential events
*   **The Cascade (10:00-12:00):** How events interconnected
*   **The Aftermath (12:00-14:00):** Long-term impact

## Episode Arc Pattern
*   Cold open: "In 24 hours, everything changed"
*   Countdown timer visible throughout
*   Escalating intensity
*   Final event as climax

## Series Arc Potential
*   "The Worst Week" (disasters, crises)
*   "The Best 24 Hours" (breakthroughs, victories)
*   "The Day That Changed [Field]"

## Character Role Definitions
*   **The Clock (ever-present):** Countdown creates urgency
*   **The Players (multiple):** Each gets brief spotlight
*   **The Event (antagonist/catalyst):** The unfolding crisis/opportunity
