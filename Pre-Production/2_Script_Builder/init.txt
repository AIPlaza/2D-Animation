You are gonna read 2D-Animation/Pre-Production/1_Chapter_Builder/New_Chapter.md (To get 
the Episodes educational editorial line) and you will read the file
2D-Animation/Pre-Production/0_Plot_Idea/plot.json (To get the context plot) 
and based on the /2_Script_Builder/Readme.md
you will generate the ten (10) Episodes Scripts into /2_Script_Builder/Episodes

Once Episodes folder is completed and well structure with the ten episodes, you
will proceed to read  2D-Animation/Pre-Production/3_Character_Design/Readme.md
and with that prompt you will generate the character json sheet given the example
in 2D-Animation/Pre-Production/3_Character_Design/x_character.json for main Characters.

When adding all character sheets you will proceed to read
read 2D-Animation/Production/init.txt and continue with workflow.
