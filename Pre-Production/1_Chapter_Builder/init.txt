You are gonna read Readme.md and Chapter_model.md and "Chapters" Folder (in case previous chapters had been built and 
you can keep consistency and semantical context in the idea) then you can get the context to generate
the needed chapter with its sections (10) and you will save it replacing any existing content in "New_Chapter.md".

You will get Topic from "Topic.md"
